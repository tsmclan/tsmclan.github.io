Workers attempting to complete the same task repeatedly may not be harmful in cases where the aim of a requester is to gather data or annotations, wherein more contributions from a single worker are fruitful. However, in several cases where the outcomes are subjective, requesters prefer the participation of distinct crowd workers.

Road networks are first and foremost modeled in a logical manner. As an oversimplified example, a road segment has an ID, a start node, an end node and a length. If the end node of this segment is the start node of another segment, then, hey, you got yourself a connected network! This is a simple, logical connection that can be modeled with a couple of tables. And it doesn’t matter how many bends or turns the geometry that connects the two nodes has, it doesn’t matter on which projection it is on, and it also doesn’t matter what the length the geometry thinks that it has. Bentley’s Assetwise ALIM considers geometries as just another attribute of the network (be it a road segment or a route). This allows our users to easily deal with complex network configurations such as self-intersecting routes, roundabouts, slip lanes, or dual carriageways.</p>

<p>It can be seen as a new way of organizing the drivers to participate in carpooling or ride-sharing, like doing spatial crowdsourcing tasks [28]. There are several spatial crowdsourcing platforms (such as DiDi, UBER, Gigwalk and BRUBHUB to name but a few) that provide drivers with monetary incentives in exchange for their efforts. A surge of research into CPD services have been developed to properly allocate tasks with the aim to either minimizing delivery cost (e.g., distance, time [1,2] and the number of selected vehicles [3]) or maximizing the number of transhipments [4-7]. Typically, the platform specifies the price per unit distance (or time) for the tasks and allots tasks if only their requesters accept the unit prices [9-11].</p>

<p>These methods have made progress to some extent, however, they still suffer from some limitations. The CPD is similar, but quite different from traditional delivery that relies on specialized contractors on markets; requesters in crowdsourcing markets typically outsource large quantities of simple tasks to uncommitted or even surrogate drivers. Actually there exists a great uncertainty on the CPD markets, but most methods optimistically assume that drivers will certainly accept the packages allocated by algorithms, rarely considering whether they are committed or not, whether they are satisfied with the fixed payment for their delivery efforts. </p>
<p>Designing effective pricing and allocation schemes presents a challenging problem due to requesters’ constraints and the realities of the CPD markets. </p>
<p>Motivated by this example, we formulate the CPD problem with Dynamic Pricing (CPD-DP) that aims to deal with dynamic pricing with the dynamics of the demand and supply on multiple local markets. To solve the CPD-DP problem, we ﬁrst propose a Delaunay Triangulation based (DT-based in short) pricing strategy to price each package with guarantees to set a personalized base price. Then we establish a reward model with the package’ s temporal and price constraints, and also an acceptance model based on the temporal discounting theory [14] to estimate drivers’ psychological reward.</p>
<p>Abstract. 
Crowdsourced package delivery (CPD) has gained great interest from the logistics industry and academe due to its signiﬁcant economic and environmental impact. A number of progresses have been reported, however, dynamic pricing, as a special and significant part of the uncertain CPD markets, is far less explored. To address the problem, we propose a novel Delaunay Triangulation based pricing strategy for dealing with the imbalanced demand and supply in local markets with the aim to maximizing the profit of the CPD platform. To cater to drivers’ wishes further, we apply the hyperbolic temporal discounting function to estimate their psychological reward in order to increase the possibility of package acceptance. We propose a three-stage framework consisting of the DTbased pricing, the two-phase matching pruning and the package assigning algorithm, to figure out the best-possible package-driver matching. With the dataset generated by Brinkhoﬀ road network generator in the city of Jinan, China, we have conducted a series of experiments to evaluate the proposed approach against several representative baseline approaches. Experimental results show that our approach significantly outperforms the other approaches in terms of effectiveness and efficiency.</p>
<p>We propose to use the well-known Delaunay Triangulation (DT) - a partition of a geometric region, defined by a point set or a polytope, into simplices that meet only at shared faces [92] - to partition packages into a set of triangles, as shown in Fig. 1 by the dashed triangles connecting (package) points, which are best according to some criterion that measures the ratio of packages to drivers, shape, or number of triangles.</p>
<p>[92] Marshall Bern and David Eppstein. Mesh generation and optimal triangulation. Computing in Euclidean Geometry (Ding-Zhu Du and Frank Hwang, editors), Lectures Notes Series on Computing, volume 1, pages 23-90. World Scientific, Singapore, 1992.</p>
<p>Table 1 provides the $maxR_p$ to reward the driver for each package after the dynamic pricing determined by the results of DT. Note that there are three drivers in the neighbour of $p_4$, its price is thus down to 6.23 because the supply is larger than the demand. In contrast, $p_1$’ is increased to 7.19 with aim to encourage the non-local driver to move here in pursuit of more payment. So the adjustment of price leads to a more proper solution {&hellip;}, as denoted by the yellow short arrows in Fig.1. Thus the total revenue is increased from 25 to 32. </p>
<p>. Finding ways to increase every possiblity that encourages drivers to finish their assignments is indispensable, which has significant impact on the total revenue of CPD markets.</p>
<p>Given the input package points, a Delaunay Triangulation based (DT-based in short) pricing strategy is then applied to partition the plane into polygonal cells containing closer points and thus figure out a proper price for each package by counting the number of drivers in the neighbour. With the indivdual prices settled, two efficient matching pruning algorithms are adopted to generate the best-possible candidate drivers for each package while satisfying the price and temporal constraints.</p>

<p>bipartite graph is constructed based on the set of packages and that of drivers and the maximum weighted bipartite matching algorithm is utilized to find the optimal package-driver matching.</p>
<p>To establish a sound incentive mechanism, we make the first effort to partition packages into a set of triangles by the well-known DT technique in order to find the tradeoff between the demand of packages and the supply of drivers. Also we use hyperbolic temporal discounting function to establish a package acceptance model that can estimate the psychological reward of the driver.</p>
<p>The package demand and driver supply are geographically imbalanced in distribution. Traditional fixed unit-price methods assume that the packages located in the same grid has same unit price. This is usually unrealistic since the demand and supply varies from a local market to another one. To solve this issue, we adopt the DT technique to divide the Euclidian plane into triangulation meshes, which capture the peculiar demand of packages and the corresponding supply of drivers, leading to a reasonable customized pricing. To do so, we select packages’ origins as vertexes to triangulate the plane. The DT of a package point set is the planar dual of the famous Voronoi diagram, which is a partition of the plane into polygonal cells, one for each input point, so that the cell for input point $p$ consists of the region of the plane closer to $p$ than to any other input point. </p>
<p>According to an introduction by Bern and Eppstein [28], if no four points lie on a common circle - as illustrated by the dashed circles in Fig.1, then each vertex of the Voronoi diagram has degree three, and the DT, which has a bounded face for each Voronoi vertex and vice versa, will indeed be a triangulation. In implementation, a triangular mesh generator rests on the efficiency of its triangulation algorithms and data structures. There are many DT algorithms, for more information on DTs and Voronoi diagrams, see the surveys by Aurenhammer [3].</p>

<p>Advancements in the size and popularity of the e-commerce industry means that the pressures and importance of the supply chain and logistics. Working intelligently is more crucial than ever to determine business success. Crowdsourced package delivery is emerging as the latest technology that allows drivers to provide on-the-way delivery by using the excess capacity of their vehicles. This upgrades the operations and logistics among companies such as Amazon, DHL, SF, BestBuy and Macy, to the state of fast-paced delivery services and reduced transportation costs.</p>
<p>Crowdsourced delivery has become a new opportunity to decease the strain on transport efficiency with the fast growth of online shopping. This is a mixed mode of passenger flows and transportation flows. The new mode entails the use of excess capacity of vehicles on journeys that already take place to support package delivery operations to enable faster and cheaper deliveries. At the same time, the participants can obtain the financial rewards that offer incentives to make more participants join the delivery process.</p>

The rapid development of online shopping is changing the logistics industry today. As the online retailers look to speed up delivery times and press down their growing multibillion logistics bill, Amazon continues to expand its same-day delivery services (Lurye 2018) and even quietly inviting drivers to handle its standard packages, the new “on-demand” delivery service also became available among companies such as DHL, SF, BestBuy and Macy. As companies continuously seek to explore new ways to provide customers with faster service, crowdsourced package delivery is emerging as a successful and fast-growing area of the crowdsourcing landscape that provides a solution to reducing logistics cost and traffic congestion by leveraging the crowd of taxis.</p>

<p>The maturity of wireless network and the popularity of mobile devices provide strong support for implementing spatial crowdsourcing, allowing people on the Internet to complete time-constrained and location-based real tasks in the physical world. Good examples are applications used in everyday life like Didi Chuxing and Baidu Waimai that apply the idea of crowdsourcing to serve people. Regarded as the core and tough problem on the research of spatial crowdsourcing, task assignment aims to allot spatial tasks to appropriate workers with enconomic space and time cost. In point this paper proposes a reward model and its task matching algorithm for spatial crowdsourcing. And we solved the problem by CPLEX and conducted several experiments on the Gowalla benchmark in the real world. The empirical results show that the proposed method performs better especially on task matching rate and feasibility, thus it is possible to provide optimized solution to spatial tasks.</p>

<blockquote>
    <span>Workers of the spatial crowdsourcing platform complained that the time spent on commuting between different locations to perform different tasks is non- negligible and is unpaid[1]. </span>
</blockquote>

<p>Therefore, in <a href="/rdings/chc/sc/DASFAA16-SpatialTasks.pdf">this paper</a>, we study the assignment of spatial tasks to workers with the objective of minimizing the <strong>“commuting cost”</strong> which can refer to time and transportation fee. &hellip; In addition to cost optimization, we are seeking solutions that are <strong>socially fair</strong>. Namely, we are looking for solutions that minimize the variance of the workload among workers. We want to assign a similar number of tasks with a similar total cost to each worker. No worker should, preferably, be overloaded or starved.<sup id="fnref:3"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:3">3</a></sup></p>

<p>One major difference from existing SC paradigms [Kazemi and Shahabi 2012; He et al. 2014; To et al. 2015; Xiao et al. 2015; Guo et al. 2016] is that workers in our paradigm do not need to travel to the exact task locations, e.g., to the centers of the circular regions, and are eligible to perform tasks as long as they are in close spatiotemporal vicinity of the tasks, e.g., enclosed in the circular regions. We denote this new paradigm as <a href="/rdings/chc/sc/to17realtimeFramework4taskAssignment.pdf">Hyperlocal Spatial Crowdsourcing</a>. <sup id="fnref:2"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:2">2</a></sup> The reason is two-fold.

<p>With the rapid development of online shopping, package delivery service has become increasingly important in modern logistics. Despite the great attempts at such services, online retailers have not had a profitable solution. In this paper, we use the crowd of taxis to make the delivery services more economical and environmentally friendly. Specially, we propose a MADesCloser algorithm to improve the baseline Destination-Closer(DesCloser) algorithm with no limitation on carrying capacity and using A* algorithm to estimate the distance to the destination of packages. Then, based on the improved algorithm, we propose an novel multi-objective routing algorithm, namely, MMADesCloser (Max-Waiting-Time and Max-Capacity DesCloser) to find the pareto solution set. And then applying a mathematical method of MOP, we obtain the optimum solution of the MMADesCloser algorithm whose Max-Waiting-Time equals 11 and Max-Capacity equals 6. Finally, we evaluate the performance of improved algorithms using the data sets, which consist of road network and the large-scale trajectory data respectively generated by Brinkhoff road network generator in the city of Luoyang, China. Results show that, our improved algorithm performs higher success rate, lower average number of particpating taxis, less average delivery distance and less average delivery time. Especially, MMADesCloser have best performance on the success rate of more than 88% , lowing the package backlog of interchange stations and reducing the total waiting time of all packages to 14916.6 time slices with failure in delivering.</p>

As the online retailers look to speed up delivery times and press down their growing multibillion logistics bill, Amazon continues to expand its same-day delivery services (Lurye 2018) and even quietly inviting drivers to handle its standard packages, the new “on-demand” delivery service also became available among companies such as DHL, SF, BestBuy and Macy. As companies continuously seek to explore new ways to provide customers with faster service, crowdsourced package delivery is emerging as a successful and fast-growing area of the crowdsourcing landscape that provides a solution to reducing logistics cost and traffic congestion by leveraging the crowd of taxis.</p>

<p>However, none of them to our knowledge have paid sufficient attention to the conflict between optimization objectives. Instead their means of solving such problems were primarily focused on how to filter out no good candidates as early as possible and how to scalarize conflicting objectives into a single objective (i.e. weighted sum) for linear optimization. Typically, a crowdsourced delivery model has objectives: the average success rate (fsr) and the average number of participating taxis (fnpt), which vary with the maximum waiting time (MaxWT) and the maximum capacity (MaxC). The experimental investigation on real data validate their non-linear competitive relationship when &hellip; as shown in Fig.1. This indicates how difficult to determine the proper weights to capture the trade-off of competitive objectives, which inevitably degrades the performance of the delivery path planning.</p>
<p>In this paper, the real-world crowdsourced delivery problem is naturally posed as non-linear programming problems having multiple conflicting objectives and solved in a multi-objective optimization fashion as it is. </p>
<p>Many real-world search and optimization problems are naturally posed as non-linear programming problems having multiple conflicting objectives. </p>

<p>Despite the great potential, ridesharing, especially with dynamic queries, has not been thoughly investigated on large-scale road networks often with many turns and one-way roads. In this paper, we treat one-way roads and viaduct roads of urban road network as heuristic information, and improve the response time of a three-phased ridesharing framework by pre-pruning some drivers to avoid complex shortest path calculation. We evaluate the proposed method using the data sets, which consist of road network and the large-scale trajectory data respectively generated by Brinkhoff road network generator in the city of Jinan, China. Results show that, our algorithm achieves a very high pruning ratio with little response time &ndash; only about 300ms in the case of 5000 drivers. It can be concluded that the improved framework is more effective for solving practical application problems. </p>

<p>Dynamic ridesharing is a successful and fast-growing area of the crowdsourcing landscape that provides a solution to reducing traffic congestion and parking pressure by sharing ones commute with other people. </p>
<p>Although partially easing the complexity behind the creation of ridesharing, these techniques still assume an oversimplified model of road networks. Typically, the straight line distance (i.e. Euclidean distance) is utilized regardless of the road network that are being used. It does not consider on which projection it is on, and it also does not matter what the distance the real route thinks that it has. So they turn out to be dispointing for rider-matching on road networks with roundabouts, one-way roads, or dual carriageways, and thus cannot be considered as a proper ready-to-use solution in real applications. </p>
<p>While Euclidean distance has been used as a heuristic to search for the closest POIs by their road network distance, its improvement on large-scale road networks has not been thoroughly investigated. </p>
<p>We propose to optimize real-time ridesharing with heuristics for road networks such as one-way roads and travel directions. These heuristics are embedded in a three-phased framework for real-time rider-matching <sup id="fnref:1"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:1">1</a></sup>. The first phase is pre-pruning, and the second phase is skyline pruning, while the third phase is the computation of shortest paths. In the first phase, we judge whether the driver is on the one-way road, then prune the driver through the calculation of the Euclidean distance. In the second phase, we use skyline computations in terms of price and waiting time to avoid providing riders too many candidate drivers satisfying all riders&rsquo; constraints.</p>
<p>We evaluate the proposed heuristics extensively using large-scale MNTG data sets. The experimental results show that, the size and accuracy of candidate drivers can be greatly improved after the prunning. Even with one-way road heuristic, our algorithm  significantly maintains high matching accracy. The proposed heuristics improve matching accuracy and efficiency of the three-phased framework.</p>

<p>An ‘Deep’ and ‘Deep RL’ Framework for Task Arrangement in Spatial Crowdsourcing
Crowdsourcing provides a convenient platform to collaboratively perform complex tasks. However, it is still an challenge for crowdsourcing schemes to assign complex tasks to the most suitable workers, for the difficulty to measure the skills quantitatively of every worker in large-scale tasks or situations need assigning tasks to workers who are the most suitable but unavailable temporarily. To this end, we investigate how to realize optimal complex task using Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL). Firstly, a deep recurrent neural network prediction model of workers-task matching degree is established to measure the skills quantitatively of a new worker, which is trained by historical task records of existing workers. Next, an DQN based RL framework is proposed to optimize the task allocation problem. In this framework, crowdsourcing problem is modeled as a sequential decision problem, where a DQN agent chooses whether to match the waiting task sequence and free workers at each time. The agent takes the waiting task sequence and skills quantities of free workers predictied by the  prediction model metioned above as state inputs. Considering that the sequence length is dynamic, we add a LSTM layer to networks of DQN to realize the unfixed length of information input with fixed length of network input interface. Comprehensive experimental results demonstrate that our work significantly outperform related proposals.</p>

<p>Despite that Spatial Crowdsourcing (SC) is a promising paradigm for solving task cheaply via crowds of mobile users, task arrangement remains a signicant challenge due to highly unstable participants in terms of arrival and skill and commitment. To address this issue, this paper investigates how to realize uncertain descion making using Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL). Firstly, a deep recurrent neural network prediction model of workers-task matching degree is established to measure the skills quantitatively of a new worker, which is trained by historical task records of existing workers. Next, an DQN based RL framework is proposed to optimize the task allocation problem. Unlike previous deterministic optimization and supervised learning techniques, SC is modeled as a sequential decision problem in our framework, where a DQN agent chooses whether to match the waiting task sequence and free workers at each time. The agent takes the waiting task sequence and skills quantities of free workers predictied by the  prediction model metioned above as state inputs. Considering that the sequence length is dynamic, we add a LSTM layer to networks of DQN to realize the unfixed length of information input with fixed length of network input interface. Comprehensive experimental results demonstrate that our work significantly outperform the state-of-the-art on several problems and benchmark datasets.</p>
